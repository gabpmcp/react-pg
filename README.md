## Introduction

In frontend development, design patterns offer reusable solutions to common problems, promoting best practices and making code easier to understand and maintain. Functional design patterns, in particular, bring advantages such as easier testing, reduced side effects, and enhanced readability.

## Functional Design Patterns

### Composition

**Composition** refers to the process of combining simple functions to build more complex functionality. Instead of relying on inheritance, functions are composed together, promoting reusability and simplicity.

### Currying

**Currying** is the process of transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for partial application of functions, improving reusability.

### Memoization

**Memoization** is an optimization technique that caches the result of a function call based on its inputs. If the same inputs occur again, the cached result is returned, avoiding the need for recalculation.

### Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)

**Higher-Order Functions (HOFs)** are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results. HOFs are central to functional programming, enabling powerful abstractions and code reuse.

### Immutability

**Immutability** involves creating data structures that cannot be modified after their creation. Instead of changing an object or array, a new copy with the desired changes is returned. This practice reduces bugs related to state changes.

### Functional Core, Imperative Shell (FCIS)

**Functional Core, Imperative Shell (FCIS)** is a pattern that separates the pure, functional core of an application from the imperative shell that handles side effects like I/O operations. The functional core is predictable, testable, and easy to reason about, while the imperative shell manages the interaction with the outside world, such as user inputs, API calls, or database operations. This pattern ensures that the core logic remains pure and functional, improving maintainability and scalability.

## Structural Design Patterns

### Container/Presentational Components

This pattern separates components into two categories: **Container Components** handle the logic and state, while **Presentational Components** focus on how things look. This division improves the separation of concerns and makes components more reusable.

### Module Pattern

The **Module Pattern** is used to encapsulate and organize code into self-contained units. This pattern helps manage dependencies and promotes a clean, modular architecture.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy Pattern** allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is useful for implementing different behaviors in a flexible and reusable way.

## Conclusion

Implementing these design patterns in frontend development not only promotes code reuse and maintainability but also aligns with the principles of functional programming, leading to more predictable and reliable codebases. By adopting these patterns, you can create scalable applications that are easier to test, debug, and extend.
